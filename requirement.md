My Portfolio should speak for itself. I don't want it to be crammed, yet it should speak about my most important work and the skills that i know of. I don't know if I am conveying them properly. but you decide and check. make any kind of revamp it needs. The recruiter should easily be able to understand what my top work is and where i am strong at.

I have recently done projects which i havent even added yet. For example:
I have been working on AI inference, building Intelligent agentic applications (AGENT THAT  KNOWS how to reason over long context horizon, planning, tool use memory etc.,)

My skills are: Langchain, lang graph, langsmith, AI Inference and model training. go through my blogs also to see what i have worked on and add only those required skills. remove un necessary stuff.

I am interested in model training(post traininig ) in geneeral like GRPO techniques, DPO etc., although the project for that is still in pipeline.

Somethings I want my portfolio to scream out are that i can build good agentic systems. highlight my relevant work experience properly. present it in whatever the best way you can and my portfolio should look good.

start with this and we will work from there. Ask me if you have any questions
